Python coding excercise
========================

Write a re-usable, unit-tested, piece of python code that returns the name and population of the county whose population is closest (in absolute) to the average population of all counties, for a given year.
The data can be fetched from this URL: https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=County&measures=Population . In case the data is not accessible, a copy is included with this email  (population_per_county.json) that you can use instead (although, at the time of writing, the data is available from the URI).
If the population of the county is within +-100 of the average, print the county's record to the standard output stream, in json format (e.g. {"ID County":"05000US01001","County":"Autauga County, AL","ID Year":2020,"Year":"2020","Population":55639,"Slug County":"autauga-county-al"})
Most unexpected runtime errors should raise a custom exception (defined by you), and log an error message in the standard error stream.

The expected output for this assignement is a zip file containing:
- the implementation in python of the solution: 1 python file
- unittests: 1 python file

Guidelines and suggestions:
- The assignement is expected to take from 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete. If it takes you a lot more time, keep it simple and/or simply write a comment explaining your ideas.
- Use OOP to provide an easy to use and easy to maintain piece of code.
- Use type annotations.
- Use python3, the minor version does not matter.
- You can use standard python libraries, as well as any open source library.
- There are many acceptable solutions to this challenge, so you might have to make decisions and/or compromises.
